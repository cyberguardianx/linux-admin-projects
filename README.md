# 🐧 Linux Admin Projects – RHCSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my Linux Administration portfolio!
I am currently preparing for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam and documenting my hands-on practice, automation scripts, and learning projects here.

---

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

* 📝 **Practice scripts** → User management, backups, monitoring, automation.
* ⚙️ **Configuration examples** → `firewalld`, `SELinux`, `systemd` services.
* 📂 **Lab setups** → Disk partitions, LVM, networking, and service deployment.
* 📚 **Notes & cheatsheets** → My RHCSA study materials.

## 🛠️ Projects & Scripts

### 🔹 User Management

* `user_mgmt.sh` → Create, lock, delete, and manage user accounts in bulk.

### 🔹 Backup Automation

* `backup.sh` → Simple backup of `/home` using `tar` and scheduled with `cron`.

### 🔹 Monitoring & Alerts

* `monitor.sh` → Check CPU, memory, and disk usage; send alert if usage exceeds threshold.

### 🔹 Web Server Setup

* Script + guide to configure Apache/Nginx with firewall & SELinux rules.

## 📸 Lab Snapshots

> (Add screenshots from your VM labs here — e.g., partitioning, SELinux configs, firewalld rules)

Example:

```
lsblk
fdisk -l
systemctl status httpd
```

## 🚀 Learning Goals

* ✅ Master RHCSA exam objectives.
* ✅ Automate common admin tasks with Bash scripting.
* 🔄 Share my progress and projects regularly.
* 🎯 Long-term: Explore Linux From Scratch (LFS) and custom ISO building.
